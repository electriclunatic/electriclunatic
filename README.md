- 👋 Hi, I’m @electriclunatic
- 👀 I’m interested in sound design, digital art, virtual reality, game design and reorganizing my entire way of seeing things.
I'm working on translating Simon Hanselmann's comics right now: https://vk.com/meggmoggrus
There were some other projects which are now way of my habits:
https://vk.com/toffysplayer
https://opensea.io/ElectricLunatic (the most effort in CryptoNautilus but it's a mess right now. I thought of making it a token collection for some app or anything reasonable)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, Arduino and how to put together all my wide range (but not really successful) experience for creating a fun project like a computer game or a designer site.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... Well, I'm kinda get used to make everything myself and I don't feel enough confidence in my projects until I know every step of the process. to wasted anybody'd time. I'm a bit low on money in this period of life so I can only think of business projects that is not really my thing. I feel more comfortable in backend.
- 📫 @ElectricLunatic - telegram, same name for Discord and any other public person accounts.
- Thanks.
