- 👋 Hi, I’m @electriclunatic
- 👀 I’m interested in sound design, digital art, virtual reality, game design and reorganizing my entire way of seeing things.
I'm working on translating Simon Hanselmann's comics right now: https://vk.com/meggmoggrus
There were some other projects which are now way off my habits:

https://opensea.io/ElectricLunatic (the most effort in CryptoNautilus but it's a mess right now. I thought of making it a token collection for some app or anything reasonable)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, got a bunch of microcontroller stuff to understand all the remote control stuff and automation it can perform.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... Well, I'm kinda get used to make everything myself and I don't feel enough confidence in my projects until I know every step of the process. I'm a bit low on money in this period of life so I can only think of business projects that is not really my thing. I feel more comfortable in backend. And hope all this nonsebce is gonna change anytime soon. Thanks, doc.
